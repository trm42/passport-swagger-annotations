# OpenAPI 3.0 Annotations for Laravel Passport 7

For the time being this is a bit untested work for Laravel Passport to get OpenAPI OAuth definitions done.

Fixes are more than welcome for this :)

## Instructions

* Clone this repository
* Copy `LooseAnnotations` dir to your `App` dir
* Configure l5-swagger package accordingly

Check your generated OpenAPI Documentation to see OAuth stuff :)
